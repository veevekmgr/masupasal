										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="topic-highlight">Buffalo meat</span> is used as a food item in a similar way to other meats such as beef (e.g., grilled, fried, etc.).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chicken is probably the most popular of all meat products. Chicken is probably the most eaten and most loved non-vegetarian food product. This bird was probably domesticated in the very early centuries, after the nomadic man started settling down and domesticated animals for his benefit.</p>
<p><b>Interesting Facts</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The human body can derive about 30 different nutritional substances from just 100 grams of chicken.</li>
<li>Just as the nutritional value of chicken is very high, so is the energy measure. 100 grams of this meat contains about 916 kilojoules of energy.</li>
<li>More than half the <i>entrées</i> ordered in fast food chains, hotels, motels, and restaurants are versions of fried chicken.</li>
<li>The chickens that are used to make soup products are known as “stewing hens”.</li>
